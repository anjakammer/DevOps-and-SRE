- For every task, write down your initial thoughts, assumptions, and the final outcome in full sentences. Describe the process of solving the task.
- If you are not able to solve the task, describe how you would solve it theoretically. You should still provide a step by step description from the documentation or tutorial you found.
- Provide a reference for every documentation or tutorial you used to solve a task. Paraphrase and cite correctly, please.
- Your submission should be described in __at least one, but not more than three A4 pages__.

## Tasks

1. Read through all tasks first. You will research how YouTube scaled its system over the years. If you are watching one of their talks on this topic, make notes and reference the video or podcast correctly in your submission. Which sources did you find and use?
2. What was the initial Architecture and Infrastructure of YouTube?
3. When did they decide to take special care of scaling? What were the events that showed that YouTube has to take scaling measures?
4. Explain what they did to be more resilient against high demand.
5. Include a self-made diagram of YouTube's improved Architecture and Infrastructure. Don't forget to reference your sources, also for the content of this diagram.
