# Public Cloud Services

This exercise aims to learn what kinds of services public cloud providers offer. You have the option to try out one specific public cloud service practically and document it. Another option is to describe a few services, theoretically.

## Exercise Rules

- Create an exercise documentation (en|de) while you are working on the tasks. This is your submission for the exercise.
- For every task, write down your initial thoughts, assumptions, and the final outcome in full sentences.
- If you are not able to solve a task, describe how you tried to find information, and what was confusing you.
- Provide a reference for every documentation or tutorial you used to solve a task. Paraphrase and cite correctly, please.
- Try to submit at __least one, but not more than two A4 pages__ for your exercise documentation in pdf format.

## Tasks

1. Choose one of the following public cloud providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform. There is no wrong option. Explain why you picked your choice. These are the cloud providers product (service) pages:

   - [AWS Cloud Services](https://aws.amazon.com/products)
   - [Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services)
   - [Google Cloud Platform Services](https://cloud.google.com/products)

2. You have two options to solve this task, pick one:

   a. You pick a particular cloud service from your chosen cloud provider and try it out practically. An example could be the creation of a private container registry, where you are pushing and pulling private container images. Another Example is to create a cloud function using some FaaS, where you are able to successfully deploy code and test the resulting endpoint. For your submission, you are documenting every step and findings. You also provide a simple, self-made diagram, showing how the service works or how it interacts with other services, traffic, or data. Every cloud provider offers its services free of charge for new accounts using credits or free-tiers.

   b. You pick one cloud service for each of the following categories from your chosen cloud provider:

   - Developer Tools
   - Compute
   - Container
   - Serverless / Serverless Computing
   - Storage

   Your task is to describe these services, how they work, and when to use them, theoretically. Pick one of your described services and provide a simple, self-made diagram, showing how the service works or how it interacts with other services, traffic, or data.
   If you chose the cloud provider Azure, you will need to use the search function of the product page, to find 'Serverless' products - there is no special category for that.

## This will help you

- Using a search engine for terms you do not know
- Watching YouTube videos for your chosen services
