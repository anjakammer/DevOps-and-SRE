# Grafana

This exercise aims to learn how to use Grafana for visual monitoring and to set up alerts.

## Exercise Rules

- Create an exercise documentation (en|de) while you are working on the tasks.
- For every task, write down your initial thoughts, assumptions, and the final outcome in full sentences. Describe the process of solving the task and provide code snippets and screenshots if needed.
- If you are not able to solve the task because you are not getting the tool to work, describe how you would solve it theoretically. You should still provide e.g. code snippets or a step by step description from the documentation or tutorial you found.
- Provide a reference for every documentation or tutorial you used to solve a task. Paraphrase and cite correctly, please.
- Your submission should be described in __at least one, but not more than two A4 pages__.

## Tasks

1. Visit the [Grafana Tutorial](https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals), and go through every step and task of it. You will use docker-compose to start Grafana and Prometheus locally.
2. For step 5 'Explore your metrics' - how does the graph and table changes in the course of modifying the query and why?
3. Add the end of step 9 'Annotate events', take a screenshot from your Dashboard, and add the image to your exercise submission.
4. For step 10 'Set up an alert' - when you are about to create a webhook URL using requestbin, you might want to just use this URL to create one: [https://requestbin.com/r](https://requestbin.com/r)
5. Add the end of step 10 'Set up an alert', take a screenshot from your Dashboard, and add the image to your exercise submission.
