# Grafana

This exercise aims to learn how to use Grafana for visual monitoring and to set up alerts.

## Exercise Rules

- Create an exercise documentation (en|de) while you are working on the tasks.
- For every task, write down your initial thoughts, assumptions, and the final outcome in full sentences. Describe the process of solving the task and provide code snippets and screenshots if needed.
- If you are not able to solve the task because you are not getting the tool to work, describe how you would solve it theoretically. You should still provide e.g. code snippets or a step by step description from the documentation or tutorial you found.
- Provide a reference for every documentation or tutorial you used to solve a task. Paraphrase and cite correctly, please.
- Your submission should be described in __at least two, but not more than four A4 pages__.

## Tasks

Visit the [Grafana Tutorial](https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals), and go through every step and task of it. __For every step of the tutorial__, write down your initial thoughts, assumptions, and the final outcome in full sentences. You will use docker-compose to start Grafana and Prometheus locally.
1. For step 5 'Explore your metrics' - how does the graph and table changes in the course of modifying the query and why?
2. At the end of step 9 'Annotate events', take a screenshot from your Dashboard, and add the image to your exercise submission.
3. At the end of step 10 'Set up an alert', take a screenshot from your Dashboard, and add the image to your exercise submission.
4. Shut down all components with docker-compose with the following command, executed in the directory the docker-compose.yml file is located in: `docker-compose down`
